## General description:

This page was created as homework to practice creating a form.

The site is fully about travel to Egypt. This website was created to prepare travelers for this country on how to prepare and behave. The site was created in such a way as to show my programming skills.

The information on the website is for the year **2023**.

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- BEM convention
- Normalize
- GIT

## Folders:

The files include folders such as : **css, js, images** and **index.html**.

## CSS:

This folder is divided into **9 files** : **article.css, form.css, header.css, section.css, style.css, table.css, navigation.css, footer.css, button.css**. Each of them steels individual elements on the page.

## JavaScript:CH

In this folder there is a **script.js** file in which **an algorithm** is written that **change background-color**, and to **change title**. This code I write to practise new skills.

## HTML:

Project title : Egipt-Blog

In this file there are tags and attributes that divide the document into:
`<body> <header> <section> <article>` and on `<form> <button> <navigation> <table> <footer>`.

- `<body>` - contains the entire content.

- `<header>` - contains the page title.

- `<section>` - divides the article into sections. In my case, it's more important than `<article>`.

- `<article>` - divides the sections into to smaller topics.

- `<form>` - the form is a regular contact form.

- `<button>` - buttons are used for various interactions.

- `<navigation>` - navigation takes you to a given part of the article (table of contents).

- `<table>` - The tables are used to show prices and attractions in an easier way.

- `<footer>` - the footer contains a contact form and necessary contact information.

## Font

The font used for the project is **"LATO"** downloaded from **Google Fonts**.
**Link to the font**: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital,wght@0,300;1,300;1,400&display=swap"

## README

**Readme** will evolve with the project. Be sure to check back here often to stay up to date.
